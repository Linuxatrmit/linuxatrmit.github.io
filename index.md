#Shell
When launching a terminal, you are interacting with a shell program from the command-line. Most distribution define ***bash*** as the default shell, while some have the minimal ***ash***, or ***sh*** as the default shell. There is another 3rd popular shell: ***zsh***.
<br>
The basic ***sh*** program lacks the rich features of modern shells such as: *command completion* *file-name completion* *command-history* and many more.
Other shells were popular back in the day, among the prominent one were ***tsh*** and its derivative ***tcsh***, which were pioneers in many advance features of command-line interactive editing, such as command and file-name or history completion and many others. While proving to be very influential in many aspects of shell innovation, especially the interactive aspects, it was strongly criticized in [Csh Programming Considered Harmful](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/) for its occasional parsing errors and random bugs. File descriptor handling and other advanced features were lacking.
