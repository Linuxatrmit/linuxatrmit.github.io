<h2>Useful Linux Utilities</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>ls</em></strong> - List files in the directory</li>
<li><strong><em>find</em></strong> - Search for path name, by name, size, regex match and many more
<ul>
<li><strong>-name</strong> will match the <strong><em>base</em></strong> of a file name against the shell pattern specified by the argument. The pattern arg should be quoted to prevent the shell to do file name expansion before its execution. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>chmod</em></strong> - Change the permission mode for owner/group/other, to update their read/write/execute permissions.</li>
<li><strong><em>chown</em></strong> - Changes the owner/group attributes of a file.</li>
<li><strong><em>man</em></strong> - Show help for commands.</li>
<li><strong><em>cat</em></strong> - Output the file's context to standard out.</li>
<li><strong><em>head</em></strong> - Outputs the top of stdin or a file.</li>
<li><strong><em>tail</em></strong> - Outputs the bottom of stdin or a file. Useful for following logs, especially with the -f switch.</li>

<h1>Shell</h1>

<p>When launching a terminal, you are interacting with a shell program from the command-line. Most distribution define <strong><em>bash</em></strong> as the default shell, while some have the minimal <strong><em>ash</em></strong>, or <strong><em>sh</em></strong> as the default shell. There is another 3rd popular shell: <strong><em>zsh</em></strong>.
<br>
The basic <strong><em>sh</em></strong> program lacks the rich features of modern shells such as: <em>command completion</em> <em>file-name completion</em> <em>command-history</em> and many more.
Other shells were popular back in the day, among the prominent one were <strong><em>tsh</em></strong> and its derivative <strong><em>tcsh</em></strong>, which were pioneers in many advance features of command-line interactive editing, such as command and file-name or history completion and many others. While proving to be very influential in many aspects of shell innovation, especially the interactive aspects, it was strongly criticized in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/">Csh Programming Considered Harmful</a> for its occasional parsing errors and random bugs. File descriptor handling and other advanced features were lacking.</p>
